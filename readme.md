# Webpack development environment

## This is my local webpack config, "heavily inspired" in Traversy Media. Feel free to use it and start your project with an initial configuration.

Steps
### Clone repo
### npm install
### npm run build
### npm run serve
### A new tab in your browser should open for http://localhost:3000/

## Versions
### node 14.17.0
### npm 7.11.2
### webpack 5
